# Cucumber
Installs syntax and snippets for [Cucumber](http://www.cukes.info) features and the Gherkin language.

## How to use

Source files with the `.feature` extension will automatically have syntax colouring applied. Otherwise select the `Gherkin` option from the Language Mode menu to apply colouring.

Code snippets can be inserted as with other languages (e.g. Ctrl+Space and typing a prefix). The following are included:

 - `fea` - Feature
 - `sc` - Scenario heading
 - `sce` - Scenario
 - `sco` - Scenario Outline
 - `steps`- Multiline steps
 - `giv` - Given step
 - `whe` - When step
 - `the` - Then step 

## Installation

 - You will need to install Visual Studio Code 0.10.0 or higher.
 - From the command palette Ctrl-Shift-P (Windows, Linux) or Cmd-Shift-P (OSX) select Install Extension, choose Cucumber and reload Visual Studio Code.

## Todo

 - Goto/peek step definition from a step in .feature file
 - `and` steps
 - `but` steps
